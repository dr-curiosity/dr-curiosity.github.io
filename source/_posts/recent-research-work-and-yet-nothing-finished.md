It has been six months since last time I wrote my blog. One reason is that I created a new Github account just for this blog site so I had some issues when I tried to work on a same Windows workstation with two Github accounts. The other reasons are really simple. I'm lazy and I'm shitty at writing. I really really tried to keep the grace and not use inappropriate language, like suck, shit, fuck, etc. But sometimes I just could not resist.

During the past six months, basically I did nothing except I went back to China and get married. Regarding the research, I'm just fucking irresponsible and all I can describe myself is, this dumbass really really doesn't know what he wants and what he is doing right now.

I'm so disappointed at myself and I couldn't stop thinking that did I just make wrong choices over and over again? I am the person who can easily finish the task in industry. I mean, come on, all you need to do is repeating some existing work and make it looks fancy. How hard is that? Besides, most people around you are just fucking dumb and they barely can do nothing. However, at academia, all I have done is keep questioning myself. I don't know what is next step and no one can tell me what is the next step. Otherwise they will just do it and publish the top tier conference paper. I really don't like to live in U.S. I can't take care of myself. I only eat one time per day. I keep overeating. I don't go to gym. I don't clean my apartment. If I can do well in research then all of these shit are just fine. On the opposite, I'm just a fucking terrible Ph.D student from every perspective. I miss my parents and I miss my home. A lot.

My wife needs money so I can't say no I'm a Ph.D student I get paid like nothing. I need to figure out how to make money during other people are publishing papers and doing researches. I worked with my friends and try to make some money with some cyber security expertise but nothing goes well. Nothing.

I'm just a miserable loser who just try a little bit more to stay alive. Just try to be a little bit better. I just don't know how long I can do this anymore.

I just want to sleep and when I wake up I'm 30.
