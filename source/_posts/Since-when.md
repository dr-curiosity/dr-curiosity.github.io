Well, I have to admit that it's not easy using English to write article. Especially when you review this paper and you find out it tastes like shit. The 5-years-old spells, the simple words, all of these are reminding you that how awful you are.

But I still have to write something rather than sitting in the cubicle and wasting my precious life. I signed up for a Duke university English training course and a Computer System course of CMU. Seriously, I have got RescueTime and Pomotodo, neither one of them could save my ass. I'm still wasting time and do nothing.

Turns out I'm always a loser and I really really really want to kill myself.
